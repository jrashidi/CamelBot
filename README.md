Nvidia End-to-End Keras DNN Autonomous Vehicle

Udacity application for behvahorial control using a keras neural network that uses a CNN to output steering commands. 

In the future could use this with ROS. 

I think that it would be worth expploring using a neural network with ROS and Navigation stack and behavorial cloning to 
control autonomous ground vehicles. 

Email me if you have any questons or if you are working on any autonmous vehicle startups.
